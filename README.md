  Most of the time, you can find me in the realm of bits and bytes trying to figure out the best combination of them to make it work.
  
  At other times, I get lost into the world of fantasy through,  
    
  - animes(donghuas), movies, mangas(manhuas, manhwas),  
  - grooving tunes, or,  
  - delving into the vast world of books, wisdoms or anything that intrigues me.
